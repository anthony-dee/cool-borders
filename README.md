# Cool Borders

Cool Borders is a really small CSS library which can be used to add some gradient based border flair to your website.

It's inspired by the `explanation` class at the bottom of the CSS Tricks article [Web History Chapter 2: Browsers](https://css-tricks.com/chapter-2-browsers/). That class uses linear gradient and border rules on the element being styled as well as an absolutely positioned pseudo-element with its own linear gradient to create the whole effect.

Cool Borders uses the same approach to create the same effect but from a variety of starting points and directions.

There two types of effects - corners or three sided (like the one in the CSS Tricks article).

All effects are created using two classes; the base class `.cool-border` and another which denotes the gradient direction (only applicable to three sided effects), type and origin corner.

Using Cool Borders to create the same effect takes two classes:
`cool-border` and `cool-border-h-top-left`.
