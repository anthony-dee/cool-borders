# Cool Borders

[Cool Borders](https://github.com/anthony-dee/cool-borders) is a really small CSS library which can be used to add gradient based border flair to your website.
It's inspired by the `explanation` class at the bottom of the CSS Tricks article [Web History Chapter 2: Browsers](https://css-tricks.com/chapter-2-browsers/). Cool Borders uses the same approach to create effects with a variety of starting points and directions.

There two types of effects - corners or three sided. All effects are created using two classes; the base class `cool-border` and another which denotes the gradient direction (three sided effects) or if it's a corner effect, and the origin corner. The following code sample shows the syntax possibilities of the second class: `cool-border-{h/v/corner}-{top/bottom}-{left/right}`.
